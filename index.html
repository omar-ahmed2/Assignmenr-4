        <p>Gojo Satoru, the enigmatic and powerful sorcerer from Jujutsu Kaisen, commands attention with his snow-white
            hair, Six Eyes, and unyielding confidence. His complex personality oscillates between playful nonchalance and
            ruthless cruelty, making him a captivating character in the mystical world of curses and jujutsu sorcery.
            Whether he’s effortlessly defeating curses or imparting wisdom to his students, Gojo remains an enigma—a force
